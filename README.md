A representiation of a POMDP that is 3x4 size, represented as ....
Given a set of observations, if there is 1 or 2 walls around it (or ends state), the actions to perform in the state space, as well as the
initial state the agent is in, if there is one.

Calculates the agents belief state, or the probability of the state that it is in.
